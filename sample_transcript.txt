um so yeah basically what i wanted to talk about today was
you know the importance of uh clear communication in the workplace
and i think that uh when we're working on projects together
it's really important that we you know stay on the same page
because um if we don't then things can get really confusing
and uh people might not know what they're supposed to be doing

so anyway uh one thing that i've noticed is that when we have
our weekly meetings um sometimes the action items aren't very clear
and then people leave the meeting and they're not sure what to do next
which is obviously not ideal right

and another thing is that uh when we're sending emails
we should probably be more concise and get to the point faster
because i know i'm guilty of this too but sometimes i'll write
these really long emails and then i realize that the main point
got buried in the middle somewhere and people miss it

so yeah those are just some thoughts i had about communication
and i think if we all work on being a bit more clear and direct
it'll really help the team be more productive you know
